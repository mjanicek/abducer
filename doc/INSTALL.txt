DEPENDENCIES
------------

In order to compile and run the abducer, you'll need the following
third-party software packages:

  * a recent Mercury compiler (preferably release 10.04.2)
  * Google Protocol Buffers (preferabably version 2.3.0)
  * log4cxx (preferably version 0.10.0).
  * ZeroC Ice (tested with versions 3.3 and 3.4)

For instructions on how to install the dependencies on your machine, see
below.

The following operating systems are supported, and the abducer is regularly
tested there:

  * Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
  * Mac OS 10.6, Mac OS 10.5

If you're unsuccessfully trying to compile and run the abducer in another
environment, please contact the author.


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------

A. Installing Mercury
---------------------

1) Download the latest stable version of the Mercury compiler, it's the
   package "Compiler" at the bottom this page:

	 http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/download/release.html

2) Unpack it somewhere and enter that directory.

3) Run the following command (but only after you've read the short note
   below):

   On Linux and MacOS X 10.6, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc,asm_fast.gc --with-default-grade=asm_fast.gc

   On MacOS X 10.5, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc

   This is for your own good -- it restricts the installed versions of the
   Mercury standard library and Mercury compiler to the bare minimum.

   I also recommend using the --prefix=INSTALLPATH option to `configure'
   so that you have the installation under control. The INSTALLPATH could
   look something like

     "$HOME/Devel/mercury-10.04"

4) Run

     $ make

5) Run

     $ make install

   (Depending on the install location, you may need root access rights
    for this step.)

6) Make sure that MERCURY_HOME/bin is in your $PATH environment variable.

Voila! Your Mercury is compiled. For the instructions on how to build and
use the abducer, see further below.


B. Installing Google Protocol Buffers
-------------------------------------

On Ubuntu, use the command

  $ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev

On MacOS X using MacPorts, execute the following command:

  $ sudo port install protobuf-cpp


C. Installing log4cxx
---------------------

On Ubuntu, use the command

  $ sudo apt-get install liblog4cxx10-dev

On MacOS X using MacPorts, execute the command

  $ sudo port install log4cxx


D. Installing Ice
-----------------

Follow the installation instructions found at Ice website:

  http://www.zeroc.com


COMPILING AND RUNNING THE ABDUCER SERVER
----------------------------------------

After Mercury is installed, compile the abducer server:

  1) make sure that the variable ICE_HOME is set to the *root* of
     your Ice installation,
     e.g. ICE_HOME=/usr/local or ICE_HOME=/opt/local

  2) run
       $ make

To run the abducer server, run the file `start-abducer-server' in this
directory.
