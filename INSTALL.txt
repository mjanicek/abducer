DEPENDENCIES
------------

You'll need a recent Mercury compiler (preferably release 10.04.1) and
Google Protocol Buffers (preferabably version 2.3.0).


INSTALLING MERCURY
------------------

1) Download the latest stable version of the Mercury compiler,
   it's the package "Compiler" at the bottom this page:

	 http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/download/release.html

2) Unpack it somewhere and enter that directory.

3) Run the following command (but only after you've read the short note
   under it):

   On Linux and MacOS X 10.6, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc,asm_fast.gc --with-default-grade=asm_fast.gc

   On MacOS X 10.5, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc

   I also recommend using the --prefix=INSTALLPATH option to `configure'
   so that you have the installation under control. The INSTALLPATH
   could look something like

     "$HOME/Devel/mercury-10.04"

4) Run

     $ make

5) Run

     $ make install

   (Depending on the install location, you may need root access rights
    for this step.)

6) Make sure that MERCURY_HOME/bin is in your $PATH environment variable.

Voila! Your Mercury is compiled. For the instructions on how to build
and use the abducer, see further below.


INSTALLING GOOGLE PROTOCOL BUFFERS
----------------------------------

On MacOS X using ports, execute the following command:

  $ sudo port install protobuf-python

On Ubuntu, use the command

  $ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev


COMPILING AND RUNNING THE ABDUCER SERVER
----------------------------------------

After Mercury is installed, compile the abducer server:

  1) make sure that the variable ICE_HOME is set to the *root* of
     your Ice installation,
     e.g. ICE_HOME=/usr/local or ICE_HOME=/opt/local

  2) run
       $ make

To run the abducer server, run the file `start-abducer-server' in this
directory.
