HOW TO INSTALL MERCURY

This file describes the process of installing the Mercury compiler
in your system.

1) Download the latest stable version of the Mercury compiler,
   it's the package "Compiler" at the bottom this page:

	 http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/download/release.html


2) Unpack it somewhere and enter that directory.

3) Run the following command (but only after you've read the short note
   under it):

   On Linux and MacOS X 10.6, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc,asm_fast.gc --with-default-grade=asm_fast.gc

   On MacOS X 10.5, run

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc

   I also recommend using the --prefix=INSTALLPATH option to `configure'
   so that you have the installation under control. The INSTALLPATH
   could look something like

     "$HOME/Devel/mercury-10.04"

4) Run

     $ make

5) Run

     $ make install

   (Depending on the install location, you may need root access rights
    for this step.)

6) Make sure that MERCURY_HOME/bin is in your $PATH environment variable.


Voila! Your Mercury is compiled. For the instructions on how to build
and use the abducer, see the file `README.Abducer.txt' in this directory.
