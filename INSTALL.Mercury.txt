HOW TO INSTALL MERCURY

This file describes the process of installing the Mercury compiler
in your system.

1) Download the Mercury compiler, it's the package "Compiler" at the
   bottom this page:

	 http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/download/rotd.html

   The reason why I'm using the development branch is that it features some
   neat debugging constructions that might come handy when the Mercury
   component is connected to the rest of the system later on. It certainly
   isn't needed now (and shouldn't really be in the "logic" part, but should
   there be any problems with the Ice binding, I won't hesitate to use
   them ;)

2) Unpack it somewhere and enter that directory.

3) Run the following command (but only after you've read the short note
   under it):

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc

   I also recommend using the --prefix=INSTALLPATH option to `configure'
   so that you have the installation under control. The INSTALLPATH
   could look something like

     "$HOME/Devel/mercury-rotd-2009-07-05"

4) Run

     $ make

5) Run

     $ make install
   (For this you might need root access rights.)

6) Export environment variable MERCURY_HOME to INSTALLPATH in your shell.
   You will need this to compile the abduction server.

7) Make sure that MERCURY_HOME/bin is in your $PATH environment variable.


Voila! Your Mercury is compiled. For the instructions on how to build
and use the abducer, see the file `README.Abducer.txt' in this directory.

If you encounter any problems, ask me! My email is on the first line of
this file.
